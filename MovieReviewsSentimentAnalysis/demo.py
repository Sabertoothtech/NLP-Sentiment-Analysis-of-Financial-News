print(s.sentiment("We were pleasantly surprised with the quality of this remake. The jokes are nonstop and witty. Characters are well fleshed out with each person playing a physical opposite of their persona outside of Jumanji. A little homage is paid to Alan Parrish at the beginning of the movie, and the movie continues, 20 years after the events of 1996.he Rock is always fun, but shines as a scared nerd with no confidence. Karen Gillan is adorable as the socially awkward nerdy girl. Jack Black playing a self obsessed popular girl is laugh out loud funny. Kevin Hart as a shrunken jock with many assigned weaknesses is classic. All in all a nearly perfect family comedy that rises above lowest common denominator humor. Worth the trip to see it on the big screen. You do not have to see the original to appreciate it."))
print(s.sentiment("What a waste of my time and money. I should've trusted my instincts about the trailer and clips to not to set foot in the cinema watching this crap. Unfunny recycled jokes, lame story and kindergarden level villain. Jumanji suppose to be exciting, emotional, funny and a little scary, but this movie failed to achieve none of it. The screenwriters probably wrote the script in the bathroom on toilet paper and forgot to wipe with it their ass. Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart are from now on my official kryptonite. Arnold S. had more charisma than both of them together. Even Jack Black who I dig, gave a goosebumps level performance."))
